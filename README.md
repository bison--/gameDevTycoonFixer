workaround fix for bug in Game Dev Tycoon v **1.3.1**

I bought the game **Game Dev Tycoon**, but when I get to the 2nd Office (1M level up), the game crashes with:  

    Java Script [object Event]

So i found out it is a problem, that can be solved.  
But who wants to make this every time you launch the game?  
Thats where this tiny script comes in.

## Intsallation ##
There is NO installation.  

**NOTE**  
If you are NOT familiar with GitHub and scripting files,  
use the DOWNLOAD Button (or link below, instead of trying right-klick on the file)  
https://github.com/bison--/gameDevTycoonFixer/archive/master.zip  
and extract it.  

Just load the file, open a terminal and launch with:

    python gameDevTycoonFixer.py

alternatively make it executeable  
(right klick->settings... / open Terminal: chmod +x gameDevTycoonFixer.py)  
double click it or type:

    ./gameDevTycoonFixer.py
    
    
just BEFORE you launch the game.  
It wil fix the "problem" by itself ;)
