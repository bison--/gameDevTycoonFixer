workaround fixes for bug in Game Dev Tycoon

I bought the game **Game Dev Tycoon**, but when i get to the 2nd Office (1M level up), the game crashes with:  

    Java Script [object Event]

So i found out it is a problem, that can be solved.  
But who wants to make this every time you lauinch teh game?  
Thats where this tiny script comes in.

## Intsallation ##
There is NO installation.  
Just load this file, make it executeable  
(right klick->settings... / open Terminal: chmod +x gameDevTycoonFixer.py)  
double click it or type:

    ./gameDevTycoonFixer.py
    
just BEFORE you launch teh game.  
It wil fix the "problem" by itself ;)
